# Bounty-Hunter-s-Journey
This is a pack meant to provide a sense of progression based almost entirely around combat.
When you start, you choose one of five possible disciplines: knight, rogue, berserker, duelist, and ranger.
Each class has its own set of weapons and quest progression. 
As you progress in a class, you unlock higher tiered materials for that class, [and stronger mobs begin to spawn NOT IMPLEMENTED]






























































































Once you hit the 3rd tier in any class you might be able to unlock another, secret class....
